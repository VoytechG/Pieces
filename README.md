# [Pieces](https://gvoy.tech/pieces/)

An interactive picture exhibition with a picture editor.

This is my own project combining my passion for programming and creative work. Inspired by the original work of Bryan James (http://species-in-pieces.com/). My purpose is to create my own vision of Bryan's project, extend it with a picture editor and let everyone create and save (and possibly animate) their drwaings. 

Done with an excelent opensource p5.js library (https://p5js.org/) with convenient graphics functions. 


## Use Instructions
   C - swap between creator/showcase screen (unsaved drwaing is not lost)

###Creator:
   S - save drwaing (for current session until refresh; storage to be added)
   F [hold] - in creator, hold F and move cursor close to a triangle vertex to place the cursor exactly on the vertex
   left-mouse - place a vertex

###Showcase: 
   left/right or up/down arrow - previous/next drawing
   left-mouse - next drawing


## ToDo (for now)
 - adding color palette for editor
 - add drawings dataase (with Google Firebase)
 - refactoring
 - documentation
 - using CSS polygons for drawings
